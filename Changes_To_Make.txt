- text way too small
- header signficantly bigger 
- all text not in boxs should be white to stand out
- i would recommend also having the image above the description that way it becomes bigger and more evident to the user
- bigger buy buttin and only 1 button if can
- i would also recommend looking into a shopping cart system simliar to the one on the nuapps website
- background is very nice

Team --> check if the background works with Emanuel's page      
- with the buttons on both sides make them more white to help blemd in with the new blue background
- center the image verticaly within each of the slide show panels
